"""Common structures and data classes for the Waldur Site Agent.

This module defines the core data structures used throughout the agent:
- Configuration data classes for offerings and agent settings
- Enumerations for agent operational modes
- Structured representations of Waldur integration configuration

These structures provide type safety and clear interfaces for configuration
management across different agent components and backend plugins.
